1. Components

-  add behaviors and functionality to a GameObject. GameObjects have default components, such as the Transform and Sprite Renderer Components that you can see immediately when you create a new Sprite. In this tutorial, you will add another component, the RigidBody 2D Component, which gives a Sprite physical properties so that it can interact with gravity and other Sprites. You will position the Main Camera to watch how a Sprite responds to gravity in 2D.


2. UPdate call
- Call 50-60 times / per second


3. Rigidbody 
- Simulate physic for gameobject

4. LateUpdate
- Update after Update method excuted

5. Input
 - with Name in ProjectSetting/Input Manager

6. Global, Local trong Editor
 - Changing Z position value

7. Camera 
 - Projection: Perpective(Phối cảnh) - Orthographic(Isometric)

8. Audio Source
- In 3D you can finetune sound to make sense close-far and Left-right: Spatial Blend -> value = 1 (for 3D)

9. Transform
- Transform.forward/up/right: Normalize theo Direction Arrow in Scene 

10. Vector
- Normalized: Limit the Vector within 0-1 with same Direction to intput Vector

#Flow to your code
- Use simulator in Scene
- Use Update to spawn whatever you want like in scene


#Extension
- FOrmat document: Ctrl + K -> Ctrl + D

* SCript Extentions

1. InvokeRepeating();

# IDEA Extenstion
1. you can create loop sprite with size.x:
-   if (transform.position.x < startPos.x - repeatWidth)
  {
      transform.position = startPos;
  }
