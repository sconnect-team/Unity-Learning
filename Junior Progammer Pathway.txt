1. Components

-  add behaviors and functionality to a GameObject. GameObjects have default components, such as the Transform and Sprite Renderer Components that you can see immediately when you create a new Sprite. In this tutorial, you will add another component, the RigidBody 2D Component, which gives a Sprite physical properties so that it can interact with gravity and other Sprites. You will position the Main Camera to watch how a Sprite responds to gravity in 2D.
